# Client Logos

This directory should contain logos of your client companies.

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (preferred) or JPG
- **Dimensions**: Recommended 400x200px (2:1 ratio)
- **File Size**: Keep under 100KB per image for optimal loading
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names like `client-company-name.png`

## Current Placeholders

Replace the placeholder files (client-1.png through client-8.png) with actual client logos.

## Example Clients to Include

- Technology companies
- Financial institutions
- Healthcare organizations
- Manufacturing companies
- Retail chains
- Government agencies
- Educational institutions
- Other enterprise clients

## Best Practices

1. Get permission from clients before displaying their logos
2. Use official brand logos (not modified versions)
3. Maintain consistent sizing across all logos
4. Consider grayscale versions for uniform appearance
5. Optimize images for web (compress without losing quality)
6. Use SVG format when possible for crispness at any size
